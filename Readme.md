## Background

Bike sharing systems represent a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the entire process—from membership, rental, to returning the bike—has become automated. These systems enable users to easily rent a bike from one station and return it at another. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs worldwide, with more than 500,000 bicycles in operation. These systems are gaining significant interest due to their role in addressing traffic, environmental, and health issues.

In addition to their real-world applications, the data generated by these systems is highly valuable for research. Unlike other public transport systems (such as buses or subways), bike-sharing systems record the duration, departure, and arrival locations of every trip, turning them into virtual sensor networks that can help monitor mobility within cities. This data can potentially reveal important events or trends occurring in the city through continuous monitoring.

## Dataset Overview

The bike-sharing rental process is closely influenced by environmental and seasonal factors. Weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, and time of day can all impact rental behavior. The dataset used in this project comes from the **Capital Bikeshare** system in Washington D.C., USA, and covers the years **2011 and 2012**. The data is publicly available at [Capital Bikeshare System Data](https://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data).
