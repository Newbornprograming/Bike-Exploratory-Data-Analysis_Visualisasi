## Overview

Bike sharing systems represent a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the entire process—from membership, rental, to returning the bike—has become automated. These systems enable users to easily rent a bike from one station and return it at another. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs worldwide, with more than 500,000 bicycles in operation. These systems are gaining significant interest due to their role in addressing traffic, environmental, and health issues.

In addition to their real-world applications, the data generated by these systems is highly valuable for research. Unlike other public transport systems (such as buses or subways), bike-sharing systems record the duration, departure, and arrival locations of every trip, turning them into virtual sensor networks that can help monitor mobility within cities. This data can potentially reveal important events or trends occurring in the city through continuous monitoring.

## Project Structure
- `dataset/day.csv and dataset/hour.csv ` and ` bike_streamlit_dataset.csv ` : Directory containing the raw CSV data files.
- `YohanesDenyNovandian_ProyekAnalisisData.ipynb`: Python scripts for data wrangling, EDA, and answering analysis questions.
- `visualisasi.py`: The Streamlit dashboard application.
- `Readme.md`: This documentation file.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/Newbornprograming/Proyek-Data-Analysis_Bike-Exploratory.git
```
2. Install the required Python packages by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## Usage
1. **Data Wrangling**: Data wrangling scripts are available in the `notebook.py` file to prepare and clean the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore and analyze the data using the provided Python scripts. EDA insights can guide your understanding of air quality patterns.

3. **Visualization**: Run the Streamlit dashboard for interactive data exploration:

```
streamlit run app.py
```
Access the dashboard in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Dataset Source

The bike-sharing rental process is closely influenced by environmental and seasonal factors. Weather conditions, precipitation, day of the week, season, and time of day can all impact rental behavior. The dataset used in this project comes from the **Capital Bikeshare** system in Washington D.C., USA, and covers the years **2011 and 2012**. The data is publicly available at [Capital Bikeshare System Data](https://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data).

- `yr`: Year (0: 2011, 1: 2012).
- `mnth`: Month (1 to 12).
- `hr`: Hour (0 to 23) (only in `hour.csv`).
- `holiday`: Whether the day is a holiday (data from [Holiday Schedule](http://dchr.dc.gov/page/holiday-schedule)).
- `weekday`: Day of the week.
- `workingday`: Whether the day is a working day (1 if it is a working day, 0 if it is a weekend or holiday).
- `weathersit`: Weather situation categorized as follows:
  - 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy.
  - 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds.
  - 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm, Light Rain.
  - 4: Heavy Rain, Ice Pellets, Thunderstorm, Mist, Snow + Fog.
- `temp`: Normalized temperature in Celsius (divided by 41, the maximum).
- `atemp`: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius (divided by 50, the maximum).
- `hum`: Normalized humidity (divided by 100).
- `windspeed`: Normalized wind speed (divided by 67).
- `casual`: Count of casual users.
- `registered`: Count of registered users.
- `cnt`: Total number of bike rentals (sum of casual and registered users).
